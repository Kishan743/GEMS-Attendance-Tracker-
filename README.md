# GEMS-Attendance-Tracker-
GEMS Attendance Tracker is a lightweight Chrome extension for MITS students that reads attendance data directly from the GEMS portal and displays overall and subject-wise attendance, including conducted, attended, and absent classes, in a clean, minimal UI. It runs fully client-side and does not collect or store credentials.
